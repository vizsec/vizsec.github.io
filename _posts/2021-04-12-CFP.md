<p>We are pleased to announce that the VizSec 2021 Call for Papers is officially open! 
You have until June 21st, 2021 to complete your submission for full and short papers. 
This year, VizSec will be more closely integrated with the IEEE VIS program. VizSec will take place
    during the main week of the conference, giving VizSec authors and attendees enhanced access to IEEE VIS,
    the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual
    analytics.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of VizSec is to explore effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such
    as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography,
    privacy, user assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and
    penetration testing. We look forward to your submissions, and to hearing about your experiences at VizSec in October! </p>
