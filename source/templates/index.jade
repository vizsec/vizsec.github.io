      p <strong>Security at the Pace of Change:  Storytelling with Security Viz</strong>
      //- p <a href='files/#{year}/Speaker-keynote.pdf'>presentation</a>
      p Over the last few years, the security industry has been leapfrogged in innovation by both attackers and advances in the greater information technology landscape. Incremental changes in how we defend networks and data are no longer good enough to keep up with the pace of change. We are losing ground more rapidly than ever before.
      p The Big Data movement, when paired with visualization, gives the security industry a chance to get back to innovating and get ahead of the pace of change. Our ability to explore data in a meaningful way is critical to discovering, predicting, and ultimately detecting advanced threats in the future. The addition to new interfaces and 3D exploration models provide researchers with additional techniques to examine data and tell meaningful security stories.
      p Dan Hubbard is the Chief Technology Officer for OpenDNS. A pioneering force in Internet security for more than 20 years, Dan’s expertise spans from reputation systems to large scale data mining of the Internet and advanced classification systems. Dan joined OpenDNS to expand the company’s breadth and depth of knowledge of security and products, assist in delivering disruptive new technologies and drive innovation company-wide. Prior to OpenDNS, Dan was the CTO at Websense, where he was responsible for research and development of existing and new technologies, investigating technology trends and driving innovation globally across the company. Additionally, he conceived, built, and managed the Websense Security Labs. Dan has presented at almost every major security conference around the globe, appeared on several international media outlets and is frequently quoted in the media.

        h2 Call for Papers
      p The 11th Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) is a forum that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cyber security community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and privacy-related topics. VizSec will be held in Paris, France on November 10, 2014 in conjunction with IEEE VIS. 

      p Important research problems often lie at the intersection of disparate domains. Our focus is to explore effective, scalable visual interfaces for security domains, where visualization may provide a distinct benefit, including computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, preventing user assisted attacks, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, and penetration testing in addition to traditional network security. Human time and attention are precious resources. We are particularly interested in visualization and interaction techniques that effectively capture the insights of human analysts so that further processing may be handled by machines, freeing analysts for other tasks. For example, a malware analyst might use a visualization system to analyze a new piece of malicious software that facilitates generating a signature for future machine processing. When appropriate, research that incorporates multiple data sources, such as network packet captures, firewall rule sets and logs, DNS logs, web server logs, and/or intrusion detection system logs, is particularly desirable. 

      h3 Technical Papers
      p Full papers describing novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, practical experience, theory, analysis, or experiments and evaluations. We encourage the submission of papers on technologies and methods that promise to improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to:
      ul
        li Situation awareness and/or understanding 
        li Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response 
        li Computer forensics 
        li Recording and reporting results of investigations 
        li Reverse engineering and malware analysis 
        li Multiple data source analysis 
        li Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense 
        li Evaluation and/or user testing of VizSec systems 
        li Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations (whether from a security goal perspective or a human factors perspective)
        li Modeling system and network behavior 
        li Modeling attacker and defender behavior 
        li Studying risk and impact of cyber attacks 
        li Predicting future attacks or targets 
        li Security metrics and education 
        li Software security 
        li Mobile application security 
        li Social networking privacy and security 
      
      p Accepted papers will appear in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE500">ACM Digital Library</a> as part of the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/icp_series">ACM International Conference Proceedings Series</a>.

      h3 Posters
      p Poster submissions may showcase late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, or visual representations relevant to the VizSec community. The poster program will be a great opportunity for the authors to interact with the attendees and solicit feedback. Accepted poster abstracts will be made available on this website.

      h3 Data
      p If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at the <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2012">VAST 2012 Challenge data</a>. <a href="http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2013%3A+Mini-Challenge+3">VAST 2013</a> and <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast11/index.php">VAST 2011</a> also had cyber security data if you are looking for additional data.

          h2 Submissions
        h3 Papers
        p Papers should be at most 8 pages including the bibliography and appendices. Committee members are not required to read the appendices or any pages past the maximum. Submissions not meeting these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of their merit. Reviews are single-blind, so authors may include names and affiliations in their submissions. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. 
        p The VizSec proceedings will be published by ACM. The <a href='http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates'> ACM SIG Proceedings Templates</a> provides Word and LaTeX templates. (If you are using LaTeX, please use <strong>Option 2: LaTeX2e - Tighter Alternate style</strong>.) 
        p Authors should apply <a href='http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998'>ACM Computing Classification categories and terms</a>. 
        p ACM invites authors to submit an image representation of their article. The image must be selected from the article body and can be any of the following: art, graphic, table, figures, etc. (Image files are to be as square as possible, 100x100 ppi and in jpg format.) Authors must supply a caption with the image. The caption length should be no more than 512 characters.

        h3 Posters
        p Interested authors should submit an extended abstract as PDF of at most 2 pages including figures and references. Accepted abstracts will be made available on this website. Authors must present a corresponding poster during the workshop. The poster authors can determine the layout by themselves, but the dimensions of the posters should not exceed the A0 space (841mm x 1189mm or 33.1" x 46.8"). Additionally, poster authors are requested to give a brief oral preview during a plenary "fast forward" session.
